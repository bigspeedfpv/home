I'm **Andrew**, a software engineer based in **North Carolina**.

I specialize in **systems** and **web development** and I'm skilled in
lots of languages, including **Rust**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Kotlin**.
Check out my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/bigspeedfpv) to see some of my projects!

Recently, I've been playing with [**Gleam**](https://gleam.run), a strongly-typed
functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It's powering this site's Spotify widget.

# ...and some opinions
- Programming should be enjoyable
  - Development environments matter for productivity
  - ...but there's no "correct" setup
- Everyone should try functional programming
  - Even if you don't stick with it, it'll change your thought process
- It's okay to be unsure - it builds critical thinking
- AI is an aid for engineers, not a replacement
  - It's not your friend, either
  - Relying on it to think for you will only make your life harder
  - Knowing how to research is more necessary now than ever
- Trans rights are human rights üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
